This is the open-source code for a DOE ENERGISE project. 

The ENERGISE project team is creating an open-source software platform 
that addresses the spectrum of distribution circuit and DER management, 
including: state estimation, voltage regulation, protection, economic 
optimization, communications and cybersecurity. Our solution will safely 
allow PV penetrations of 50% or greater by providing real-time visibility 
into distribution circuits and optimizing the active and reactive (P/Q) 
DER settings to meet voltage regulation, protection and economic objectives 
in the presence of forecast uncertainty. The project is also designed to 
address major interoperability and cyber security barriers for the control 
and optimization of distribution circuits. The project will establish a 
standardized, common, open-source information model for exchange format. 
For this project, the integrated collection of control and optimization 
software will be referred to as the Programmable Distribution Resource 
Open Management Optimization System (ProDROMOS).
